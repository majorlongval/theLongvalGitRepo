This is the OOP version of the snake game. 
It implements the snake moving, collision
with self, collision with walls, and placing
and detecting the food at least the first time.

I have grown tired, and have not finished the
project. The scoreboard is not implemented. 
Perhaps I will come back later. Probably not.
